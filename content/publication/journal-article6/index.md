abstract:  With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, the security has been significantly called more and more people’s attention on wireless communication between the devices and the human-beings, as well as the devices to devices. Smart home (SH), as a small-scale example of the smart application-based field, has benefited from the concept of IoT since it uses an indoor data-centric sensor network. In SH, routing schemes are widely utilized for data aggregation purposes. However, there are three main issues, which can considerably affect the current execution of routing protocol in SH: (1) lack of technical methods for precisely regional division of the network, (2) the difficulty of differentiating data among various functional regions, and (3) the vulnerability of network with advanced internal routing attacks. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, a two-layer cluster-based network model for indoor structured SH and a novel Beta-based trust management (BTM) scheme are proposed to defend various types of internal attacks by integrating the variation of trust value, threshold, and evaluation. The proposed structure forms a secure hierarchical routing protocol called SH-PCNBTM to effectively support the data transmission service in SH networks.

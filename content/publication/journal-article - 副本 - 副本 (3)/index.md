abstract: In software-defined networks (SDNs), the deployment of multiple
  controllers improves the reliability and scalability of the distributed
  control plane. Recently, edge computing (EC) has become a backbone to networks
  where computational infrastructures and services are getting closer to the end
  user. The unique characteristics of SDN can serve as a key enabler to lower
  the complexity barriers involved in EC, and provide better quality-of-services
  (QoS) to users. As the demand for IoT keeps growing, gradually a huge number
  of smart devices will be connected to EC and generate tremendous IoT traffic.
  Due to a huge volume of control messages, the controller may not have
  sufficient capacity to respond to them. To handle such a scenario and to
  achieve better load balancing, dynamic switch migrating is one effective
  approach. However, a deliberate mechanism is required to accomplish such a
  task on the control plane, and the migration process results in high network
  delay. Taking it into consideration, this article has introduced an efficient
  switch migration-based load balancing (ESMLB) framework, which aims to assign
  switches to an underutilized controller effectively. Among many alternatives
  for selecting a target controller, a multicriteria decision-making method,
  i.e., the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution
  (TOPSIS), has been used in our framework. This framework enables flexible
  decision-making processes for selecting controllers having different resource
  attributes. The emulation results indicate the efficacy of the ESMLB.

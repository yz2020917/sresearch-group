  Abstract—Industry 4.0 have automated the entire manufacturing sector
  (including technologies and processes) by adopting Internet of Things and
  Cloud computing. To handle the workflows from Industrial Cyber-Physical
  systems, more and more data centers have been built across the globe to serve
  the growing needs of computing and storage. This has led to an enormous
  increase in energy usage by cloud data centers which is not only a financial
  burden but also increases their carbon footprint.The private Software Defined
  Wide Area network (SDWAN) connects a cloud provider’s data centers across the
  planet. This gives the opportunity to develop new scheduling strategies to
  manage cloud providers workload in a more energy-efficient manner. In this
  context, this paper addresses the problem of

  scheduling data-driven industrial workflow applications over a set

  of private SDWAN connected data centers in an energy-efficient

  manner while managing trade-off of a cloud provider’ revenue.

  Our proposed algorithm aims to minimize the cloud provider’s

  revenue and the usage of non-renewable energy by utilizing the

  real-world electricity prices with the availability of green energy

  on different cloud data centers, where the energy consumption

  consists of the usage of running application over multiple data

  centers and transferring the data among them through SDWAN.

  The evaluation shows that our proposed method can increase

  usage of green energy for the execution of industrial workflow

  up to 3× times with a slight increase in the cost when compared

  to cost-based workflow scheduling methods.

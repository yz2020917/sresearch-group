abstract: Since the conception of cloud computing, ensuring its ability to
  provide highly reliable service has been of the upmost importance and
  criticality to the business objectives of providers and their customers. This
  has held true for every facet of the system, encompassing applications,
  resource management, the underlying computing infrastructure, and
  environmental cooling. Thus, the cloud-computing and dependability research
  communities have exerted considerable effort toward enhancing the reliability
  of system components against various software and hardware failures. However,
  as these systems have continued to grow in scale, with heterogeneity and
  complexity resulting in the manifestation of emergent behavior, so too have
  their respective failures. Recent studies of production cloud datacenters
  indicate the existence of complex failure manifestations that existing fault
  tolerance and recovery strategies are ill-equipped to effectively handle.
  These strategies can even be responsible for such failures. These emergent
  failures-frequently transient and identifiable only at runtime-represent a
  significant threat to designing reliable cloud systems. This article
  identifies the challenges of emergent failures in cloud datacenters at scale
  and their impact on system resource management, and discusses potential
  directions of further study for Internet of Things integration and holistic
  fault tolerance.

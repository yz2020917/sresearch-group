  Abstract: Social media has played a significant role in disaster management,
  as it enables the general

  public to contribute to the monitoring of disasters by reporting incidents related to disaster events.

  However, the vast volume and wide variety of generated social media data create an obstacle in

  disaster management by limiting the availability of actionable information from social media. Several

  approaches have therefore been proposed in the literature to cope with the challenges of social media

  data for disaster management. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published literature on social

  media data management and analysis that identifies the research problems and provides a research

  taxonomy for the classification of the common research issues. In this paper, we provide a survey of

  how social media data contribute to disaster management and the methodologies for social media

  data management and analysis in disaster management. This survey includes the methodologies

  for social media data classification and event detection as well as spatial and temporal information

  extraction. Furthermore, a taxonomy of the research dimensions of social media data management

  and analysis for disaster management is also proposed, which is then applied to a survey of existing

  literature and to discuss the core advantages and disadvantages of the various methodologies.

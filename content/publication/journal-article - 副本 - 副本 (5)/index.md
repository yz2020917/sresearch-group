abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a backbone of sensing
  infrastructure to several mission-critical applications such as smart health,
  disaster management, and smart cities. Due to resource-constrained sensing
  devices, IoT infrastructures use Edge datacenters (EDCs) for real-time data
  processing. EDCs can be either static or mobile in nature, and this article
  considers both of these scenarios. Generally, EDCs communicate with IoT
  devices in emergency scenarios to evaluate data in real-time. Protecting data
  communications from malicious activity becomes a key factor, as all the
  communication flows through insecure channels. In such infrastructures, it is
  a challenging task for EDCs to ensure the trustworthiness of the data for
  emergency evaluations. The current communication security pattern of
  “communication before authentication” leaves a “black hole” for intruders to
  become part of communication processes without authentication. To overcome
  this issue and to develop security infrastructures for IoT and distributed
  Edge datacenters, this article proposes a user-centric security solution. The
  proposed security solution shifts from a network-centric approach to a
  user-centric security approach by authenticating users and devices before
  communication is established. A trusted controller is initialized to
  authenticate and establishes the secure channel between the devices before
  they start communication between themselves. The centralized controller draws
  a perimeter for secure communications within the boundary. Theoretical
  analysis and experimental evaluation of the proposed security model show that
  it not only secures the communication infrastructure but also improves the
  overall network performance.

abstract: |+
  Modern big data process systems are becoming very
  complex in terms of large-scale, high-concurrency and Multiple-
  talents. Thus, many failures and performance reductions only
  happen at run-time and are very difficult to capture. Moreover,
  some issues may only be triggered when some components are
  executed. To analyze the root cause of these types of issues, we
  have to capture the dependencies of each component in real-time.
  In this paper, we propose SmartMonit a real-time Big data
  monitoring system which collects infrastructure information such
  as the process status of each task. At the same time, we
  develop a real-time stream processing framework to analyze the
  coordination among tasks to tasks and infrastructures to tasks.
  This coordination information is essential for troubleshooting the
  reasons for failures and performance reduction, especially the
  ones propagated from other causes.

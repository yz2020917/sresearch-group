abstract: An earth building is still popular in the villages of China, which
  should be carefully monitored in the wet and rainy area using new information
  technology, e.g., sensor networks. However, how to design an energy-efficient
  and robust scheme in the heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSN) is a
  critical issue, since the network should be long-time available and node
  failure may lead to data delivery unreliable and network collapse. In this
  paper, an energy-efficient topology control (EETC) algorithm is proposed for
  energy saving and load balancing of the network. In EETC, cluster heads are
  selected by the geometric method and well-distributed in the monitor area,
  while the non-cluster head members in each cluster are adjusted by Minimal
  Cost Maximal Flow (MCMF) so as to permit each cluster has the similar number
  of the cluster member. Furthermore, we design topology maintenance with
  partial adjustment using Breadth First Search (BFS) and shortest-path routing
  protocol in order to prolong the network lifetime. The simulation result shows
  that EETC is not only reliable to forward the data for HWSN but also has a
  longer lifetime than LEACH, EDFCM, EDCS, SPEZ and CREEP.

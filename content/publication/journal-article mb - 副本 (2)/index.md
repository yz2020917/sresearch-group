abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects physical objects including
  sensors, vehicles, and buildings into a virtual circumstance, resulting in the
  increasing integration of Cyber-physical objects. The Fog computing paradigm
  extends both computation and storage services in Cloud computing environment
  to the network edge. Typically, IoT services comprise of a set of software
  components running over different locations connected through datacenter or
  wireless sensor networks. It is significantly important and cost-effective to
  orchestrate and deploy a group of microservices onto Fog appliances such as
  edge devices or Cloud servers for the formation of such IoT services. In this
  chapter, we discuss the challenges of realizing Fog orchestration for IoT
  services, and present a software-defined orchestration architecture and
  simulation solutions to intelligently compose and orchestrate thousands of
  heterogeneous Fog appliances. The resource provisioning, component placement
  and runtime QoS control in the orchestration procedure can harness workload
  dynamicity, network uncertainty and security demands whilst considering
  different applications’ requirement and appliances’ capabilities. Our
  practical experiences show that the proposed parallelized orchestrator can
  reduce the execution time by 50% with at least 30% higher orchestration
  quality. We believe that our solution plays an important role in the current
  Fog ecosystem.

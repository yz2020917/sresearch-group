abstract: Big data processing systems, such as Hadoop and Spark, usually work on
  large-scale, highly-concurrent, and multi-tenant environments that can easily
  cause hardware and software malfunctions or failures, thereby leading to
  performance degradation. Several systems and methods exist to detect big data
  processing systems’ performance degradation, perform root-cause analysis, and
  even overcome the issues causing such degradation. However, these solutions
  focus on specific problems such as straggler and inefficient resource
  utilization. There is a lack of a generic and extensible framework to support
  the real-time diagnosis of big data systems. In this paper, we propose,
  develop and validate AutoDiagn. This generic and flexible framework provides
  holistic monitoring of a big data system while detecting performance
  degradation and enabling root-cause analysis. We present the implementation
  and evaluation of AutoDiagn that interacts with a Hadoop cluster deployed on a
  public cloud and tested with real-world benchmark applications. Experimental
  results show that AutoDiagn has a small resource footprint, high throughput
  and low latency.

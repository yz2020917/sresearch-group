abstract: The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology brings many new
  opportunities for applications in areas including smart healthcare, smart
  buildings, and smart agriculture. These applications must normally distribute
  the computations, required for extracting value from sensor data, over the IoT
  infrastructure platforms (e.g., sensors, phones, field-gateways, and clouds).
  This can be very challenging for IoT application developers due to the
  heterogeneity of the aforementioned platforms, potentially conflicting
  nonfunctional requirements (e.g., battery power, latency, and cost), and
  related deployment criteria, which is impossible to resolve manually. To
  address the above challenges, we have developed the PATH2iot framework that
  decomposes a complex IoT application into self-contained micro-operations.
  Based on the deployment criteria, PATH2iot automatically distributes the set
  of micro-operations across IoT infrastructure platforms, while respecting
  their run-time data and control flow dependencies. In our previous work, we
  have shown how to use the PATH2iot to optimize the battery life of a
  healthcare wearable. In this article, we describe a new research that
  significantly extends PATH2iot, which introduces a heuristic model capable of
  making optimal deployment decisions based on multiple conflicting
  nonfunctional requirements and selection criteria (user preferences). It does
  so by leveraging a well-known multicriteria decision-making method called the
  analytic hierarchical processes (AHP). The applicability of the deployment
  model is validated based on a real-world digital healthcare analytics use
  case. The results show that our model is able to find the optimal deployment
  solution for different user preferences.

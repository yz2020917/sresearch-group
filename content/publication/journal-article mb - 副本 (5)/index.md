abstract: >-
  In the last decade, we have been transitioning from a datapoor to a data-rich
  world with the promise of unparalleled intelligence. Such transition will
  definitely require significant investments in every aspect in our societies
  including social, political, economic and cultural. Much of the
  (unprecedented) increase in data generation can be attributed

  to the abundance of mobile devices and wearables, the

  increase of instrumentation in every industry vertical, the

  mass adoption of social networks and the digitization of

  every aspect of our lives. Generically, the bulk of such

  data collection falls under the Internet of Things (IoT).1–5

  IoT data comes from a variety of sources that can be classified into (a) machine-based (e.g., environmental, weather, air quality, water quality, flows, traffic speeds, people

  flows and GPS location) or (b) people-based (e.g., social

  media, crowd sourced data collection, and simple text

  messaging) providing data and situational observations

  associated with events.

abstract: Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) are widely used to facilitate
  accurately remote control in industrial application fields using cyberspace
  technologies. However, it is easily suffered from internal vulnerabilities and
  other external threats from cyberspace, e.g., the attacker can bypass the
  intrusion detection systems (IDS) to access inner network and destroy devices,
  due to the deployed old-fashioned hardware and software. From the view of the
  system control level, we propose a system residuals-based fingerprinting for
  attack detection, namely, R-print. We firstly abstract the actual water-level
  system as a physical model. Then the measurement noise and the process noise
  from the sensor and system operation are respectively extracted as the input
  of model, and the output residual is synthesized into the unique fingerprint.
  Furthermore, we also propose a data resampling strategy to focus on the
  problem that how to fast detect the injection attack with small-value false
  data. Finally, a small water-level control testbed was built to simulate the
  real-scenario of the industrial water treatment process. The experimental
  results verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack detection approach.

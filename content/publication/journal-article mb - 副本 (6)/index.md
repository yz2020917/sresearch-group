  Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an
  approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. Thus,
  approximate computing based on the chosen sample size — can make a systematic
  tradeoff between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. ApproxIoT is
  a stream analytics system to strike a balance between the two desirable but
  contradictory design requirements, i.e., achieving low latency for real-time
  analytics, and efficient utilization of computing resources.

  In this work, we implement ed ApproxIoT using Apache Kafka and its library Kafka Streams to achieve a truly distributed data analytics system. An online stratified reservoir sampling algorithm was implemented on both Edge computing nodes and Datacenter cluster.

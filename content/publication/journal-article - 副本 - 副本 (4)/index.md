abstract: |-
  SDN has provided significant convenience for net-
  work providers and operators in cloud computing. Such great
  advantage is extending to the IoT network. However, it also
  increases the risk if the security of a SDN network is com-
  promised. For example, if the network operator’s permission is
  illegally obtained by a hacker, he/she can control the entry of
  the SDN network. Therefore, an effective authentication scheme
  is needed to fit various application scenarios with high-security
  requirements. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate
  a new authentication scheme called The Hidden Pattern (THP),
  which combines graphics password and digital challenge value
  to prevent multiple types of authentication attacks at the same
  time. We examined THP in the perspectives of both security and
  usability, with a total number of 694 participants in 63 days.
  Our evaluation shows that THP can provide better performance
  than the existing schemes in terms of security and usability.

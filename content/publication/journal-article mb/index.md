abstract: MapReduce framework has been one of the most prominent ways for
  efficient processing large amount of data requiring huge computational
  capacity. On-demand computing resources of Public Clouds have become a natural
  host for these MapReduce applications. However, the decision of what type and
  in what amount computing and storage resources should be rented is still a
  user’s responsibility. This is not a trivial task particularly when users may
  have performance constraints such as deadline and have several Cloud product
  types to choose with the intention of not spending much money. Even though
  there are several existing scheduling systems, however, most of them are not
  developed to manage the scheduling of MapReduce applications. That is, they do
  not consider things such as number of map and reduce tasks that are needed to
  be scheduled and heterogeneity of Virtual Machines (VMs) available. This paper
  proposes a novel greedy-based MapReduce application scheduling algorithm
  (MASA) that considers the user’s constraints in order to minimize cost of
  renting Cloud resources while considering Service Level Agreements (SLA) in
  terms of the user given budget and deadline constraints. The simulation
  results show that MASA can achieve 25–50% cost reduction in comparison to
  current SLA agnostic methods and there is only 10% performance disparity
  between MASA and an exhaustive search algorithm.

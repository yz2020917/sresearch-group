abstract: We demonstrate AHOM, a system that can Actively Observe Hazards via
  Monitoring Social Media Streams. AHOM proposes an active way to include the
  human in the loop of hazard information ac-quisition for social media.
  Different from state of the art, it supports bi-directional interaction
  between social media data processing system and social media users, which
  leads to the establishment of deeper and more accurate situational awareness
  of hazard events. We demonstrate how AHOM utilizes Twitter streams and
  bi-directional information exchange with social media users for enhanced
  hazard observation.

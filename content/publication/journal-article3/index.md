abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely applied in modern human life,
  e.g., smart home and intelligent transportation. However, it is vulnerable to
  malicious attacks, and the current existing security mechanisms cannot
  completely protect the IoT. As a security technology, intrusion detection can
  defend IoT devices from most malicious attacks. However, unfortunately the
  traditional intrusion detection models have defects in terms of time
  efficiency and detection efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an
  improved linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based extreme learning machine
  (ELM) classification for the intrusion detection algorithm (ILECA). First, we
  improve the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and then use it to reduce the
  feature dimensions. Moreover, we use a single hidden layer neural network
  extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm to classify the
  dimensionality-reduced data. Considering the high requirement of IoT devices
  for detection efficiency, our scheme not only ensures the accuracy of
  intrusion detection, but also improves the execution efficiency, which can
  quickly identify the intrusion. Finally, we conduct experiments on the NSL-KDD
  dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed ILECA has good
  generalization and real-time characteristics, and the detection accuracy is up
  to 92.35%, which is better than other typical algorithms.

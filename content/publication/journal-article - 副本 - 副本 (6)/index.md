abstract: Benchmarking the containerized web-applications across multiple cloud
  gives web-application owners more chance to deploy their applications on
  cheaper host while meeting their performance requirements. However,
  benchmarking a large number of cloud hosts (about 267 cloud providers in the
  world) to find a flexible deployment option becomes a grand challenge. Users
  need to evaluate as many hosts as possible to find an option which offers
  expected performance at the lowest price. It is also necessary to benchmark
  the hosts for longer duration so that it can capture the uncertainty of cloud
  environment. In this paper, we present Smart Docker Benchmarking Orchestrator
  (SDBO), a general orchestrator that automatically benchmarks containerized
  web-applications in multi-cloud environment. At the same time, SDBO is able to
  maximize the numbers of evaluated cloud providers and type of hosts without
  exceeding users’ budgets. Moreover, we propose a flexible execution module
  which enhances SDBO ’s ability to capture the performance variation of
  benchmark web-application for longer period of time in the defined users’
  budgets.

abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been deployed in many areas and have
  reached unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency. However, the
  security and privacy problems in CPS have not been properly addressed, e.g.,
  the monitored source location can be inferred by an attacker, which can
  substantially undermine the reliability of CPS. Unfortunately, the existing
  techniques to protect against the leakage of the source location do not
  achieve an acceptable balance among the source location privacy, transmission
  delay, and energy consumption to guarantee high reliability. To address this
  issue, we propose an attacker location evaluation-based fake source scheduling
  (FSSE) for source location privacy in CPS to enhance the privacy level and
  maintain the system performance. The proposed FSSE contains two main phases.
  The first, backbone construction, is dependent on the probability of capture
  derived from the communication information of self and neighboring nodes. This
  phase aims to build a backbone to form a baseline with respect to the source
  location privacy and transmission delay. The second phase is fake message
  scheduling, which is established to provide a trade-off among privacy,
  transmission delay, and communication overhead in terms of the hypothesized
  location of the attacker by using stochastic processes. Through analysis and
  simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed method has a more stable privacy
  level and more efficient transmission delay and energy consumption than the
  three compared algorithms, i.e., phantom routing, tree-based diversionary
  routing, and dynamic fake source selection.

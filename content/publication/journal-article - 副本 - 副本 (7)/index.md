abstract: >-
  Recent advances in composing Cloud applications have been driven by
  deployments of inter-networking heterogeneous

  microservices across multiple Cloud datacenters. System dependability has been of the upmost importance and criticality to both

  service vendors and customers. Security, a measurable attribute, is increasingly regarded as the representative example of

  dependability. Literally, with the increment of microservice types and dynamicity, applications are exposed to aggravated internal

  security threats and externally environmental uncertainties. Existing work mainly focuses on the QoS-aware composition of native

  VM-based Cloud application components, while ignoring uncertainties and security risks among interactive and interdependent

  container-based microservices. Still, orchestrating a set of microservices across datacenters under those constraints remains

  computationally intractable. This paper describes a new dependable microservice orchestration framework GA-Par to effectively select

  and deploy microservices whilst reducing the discrepancy between user security requirements and actual service provision. We adopt

  a hybrid (both whitebox and blackbox based) approach to measure the satisfaction of security requirement and the environmental

  impact of network QoS on system dependability. Due to the exponential grow of solution space, we develop a parallel Genetic

  Algorithm framework based on Spark to accelerate the operations for calculating the optimal or near-optimal solution. Large-scale real

  world datasets are utilized to validate models and orchestration approach. Experiments show that our solution outperforms the

  greedy-based security aware method with 42.34% improvement. GA-Par is roughly 4x faster than a Hadoop-based genetic algorithm

  solver and the effectiveness can be constantly guaranteed under different application scales.

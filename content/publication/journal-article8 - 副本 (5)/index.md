abstract: "Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) are complementary
  advances: ML techniques unlock complete potentials of IoT with intelligence,
  and IoT applications increasingly feed data collected by sensors into ML
  models, thereby employing results to improve their business processes and
  services. Hence, orchestrating ML pipelines that encompasses model training
  and implication involved in holistic development lifecycle of an IoT
  application often leads to complex system integration. This paper provides a
  comprehensive and systematic survey on the development lifecycle of ML-based
  IoT application. We outline core roadmap and taxonomy, and subsequently assess
  and compare existing standard techniques used in individual stage."

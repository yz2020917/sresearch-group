abstract: >-
  Containerized web-applications have gained popularity recently

  due to the advantages provided by the containers including light-

  weight, packaged, fast start up and shut down and easy scalability.

  As there are more than 267 cloud providers, finding a flexible de-

  ployment option for containerized web-applications is very difficult

  as each cloud offers numerous deployment infrastructure. Bench-

  marking is one of the eminent options to evaluate the provisioned

  resources before product-level deployment. However, benchmark-

  ing the massive infrastructure resources provisioned by various

  cloud providers is a time consuming, tedious and costly process

  and is not practical to accomplish manually.

  In this demonstration, we present

  Smart Docker Benchmarking Orchestrator (SmartDBO), a general orchestration framework

  that automatically benchmarks (deploys and executes) users’ con-

  tainerized web-applications across different cloud providers while

  meeting the constraints of budget and deployment configurations.

  SmartDBO aims to answer two questions: (i) how to automate the

  benchmarking of containerized web-application across multi-cloud

  environments?, (ii) how to maximize the diversity in a benchmark-

  ing solution which covers maximum numbers of cloud providers

  and types of provisioned infrastructures without exceeding users’

  budgets? We evaluate all the features of SmartDBO using Sim-

  plCommerce and TPC-W executing across Amazon AWS and Mi-

  crosoft Azure.

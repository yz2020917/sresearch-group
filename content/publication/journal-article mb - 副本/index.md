abstract: Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) services such as healthcare,
  smart cities, and marine monitoring are pervasive in cyber-physical
  environments strongly supported by Internet technologies and fog computing.
  Complex IoT services are increasingly composed of sensors, devices, and
  compute resources within fog computing infrastructures. The orchestration of
  such applications can be leveraged to alleviate the difficulties of
  maintenance and enhance data security and system reliability. However,
  efficiently dealing with dynamic variations and transient operational behavior
  is a crucial challenge within the context of choreographing complex services.
  Furthermore, with the rapid increase of the scale of IoT deployments, the
  heterogeneity, dynamicity, and uncertainty within fog environments and
  increased computational complexity further aggravate this challenge. This
  article gives an overview of the core issues, challenges, and future research
  directions in fog-enabled orchestration for IoT services. Additionally, it
  presents early experiences of an orchestration scenario, demonstrating the
  feasibility and initial results of using a distributed genetic algorithm in
  this context.

abstract: "Abstract—An increasing number of cloud providers now offer Mobile
  Edge Computing (MEC) services for their customers to support task offloading.
  This is undertaken to reduce latency associated with forwarding data from IoT
  devices owned by customers to cloud platforms. However, two challenges remain
  in existing MEC scenarios: (i) the coverage of MEC services is limited; (ii)
  there is limited ability to develop an audit trail about which MEC service
  providers have processed a user’s data. A new architecture for automatically
  offloading user tasks in MEC scenarios is proposed which addresses the two
  challenges above. The architecture makes use of drones to dynamically cache
  data generated from IoT devices and forward this data to MEC servers that
  participate in a private blockchain network. Our simulated experiments
  demonstrate the flexibility of the task offloading process through the
  proposed architecture which can provide greater visibility of MEC service
  providers involved in processing users’ data"
